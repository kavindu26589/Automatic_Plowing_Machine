# ðŸ¤– Automatic Plowing Machine Project

Welcome to the **Automatic Plowing Machine Project** repository! This project features a smart plowing system powered by ESP32, integrating automatic and manual controls into a single streamlined solution for efficient farming operations.

---

## ðŸ§ª **Project Overview**

This repository contains the code and implementation for:
- **Hybrid Control System**: Combines automatic and manual modes for flexibility in operation.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Automatic plowing with obstacle avoidance and pathfinding.
- **Manual Override**: Provides full control to the operator when needed.

## ðŸŒŸ **Features**

- **Automatic Mode**:
  - Autonomous pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.
  - Real-time angle measurement using the MPU6050.
  - Distance calculation using wheel RPM (no tachometer required).
  - IoT-enabled operation through Blynk for remote control and monitoring.

- **Manual Mode**:
  - Operator-driven control for specific scenarios or precision tasks.
  - Simple and reliable system for hands-on operation.
